To install ESAP on Windows 7, 8, and 10 systems:

-Launch Installer
	-Grant necessary permissions
-Change install directory to file on C: drive instead of default (I usually create a new folder titled, "ESAP")
	-If you install the program in the program files folder, active control will prevent you from saving files to the folder.
-Launch "ESAP_HFInstaller"
	-Grant necessary permissions
	-Change directory to location of the "helpdocs" folder (e.g. "C:\ESAP\helpdocs")
-Check configuration folder
	-Open “ESAP_te_fio_info.dat” file found in your C: folder (e.g. "C:\ESAP")
	-Under the "ESAP default Text Editor information:" heading, make sure you have the correct filepath to "write.exe"
		-Usually "C:\Windows\Write.exe"
	-Under the "ESAP default raw survey input file path information:" heading, you should have the directory for the "data" folder in the ESAP folder (e.g. "C:\ESAP\data")

***ESAP is now successfully installed!!***

-Sometimes Permissions may not be granted to modify the "ESAP_te_fio_info.dat" file.  Make sure to right click and go to file properties and allow permissions to modify the file.
	-Make sure to do this to the "C:\ESAP" folder and also make all the files within it not "read-only" files.
