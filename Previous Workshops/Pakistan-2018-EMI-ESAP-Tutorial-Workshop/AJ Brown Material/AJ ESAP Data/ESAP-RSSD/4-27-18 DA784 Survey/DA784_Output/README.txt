An em38 survey was performed on the DA784 field on 4/29/18

The conductivity data was used as an input for the ESAP-RSSD program to select survey sampling points for generating a stochastic calibration of ECa to ECe.

12 sampling sites were chosen by ESAP - and AJ chose sampling design #2 because of the lower Opt Criteria (1.33).

When referencing this survey, always use the files with "2" in the name
gps2, rsd2, xrs2, etc...
