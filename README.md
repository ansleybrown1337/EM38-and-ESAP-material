# Electromagnetic Induction Techniques, EM38 Usage, and ESAP Software Suite Repository

Welcome to the electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique repository created by A.J. Brown.

Here I provide the materials to give you an overview of EMI methods and their applications in agriculture, specifically for characteriing soil salinity as electrical conductivity (EC). We also provide a comprehensive guide to the Electromagnetic Sampling Analysis and Prediction Model (ESAP) developed by the USDA.
